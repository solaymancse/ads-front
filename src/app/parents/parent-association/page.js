According to PTO Today, when parents are involved in a childâ€™s education, both at home and at school, children perform better academically. This includes higher grades and test scores, improved attendance, better social skills, fewer behavioral problems, and a tendency to graduate and continue their education.";

The PA's mission is to promote open communication and understanding between parents and staff of Al-Salam Day School. Our efforts serve to enhance and maximize the education of every child while aiding them in achieving their highest potential. The PTO sponsors assistance to teachers in classroom settings, holds fund-raisers for supplemental educational materials and experiences, supports school and family social interaction, and provides a non-biased forum for sharing information on issues that impact our children. It is our belief that the team effort of a parent-teacher organization offers the best possible learning environment for our children.";
